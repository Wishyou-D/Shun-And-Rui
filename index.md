**S**peaking the word of love

**O**ver a thousand miles

**N**ever seeking self

**G**iving glory to God
<br/><br/>

**R**unning as a mighty messenger

**U**tilizing all oneâ€™s strength

**I**s the one who puts faith in God
<br/><br/>

**S**he obtains favor from the Lord

**H**e dwells in the holy temple

**I**niquity exists no more
<br/><br/>

**S**hine like the light of the world

**H**ow awesome are you my friend and pal

**U**nto the day that glory comes

**N**ow we wait and hope along
<br/><br/>
